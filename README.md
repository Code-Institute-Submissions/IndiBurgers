Haley Schafer Portfolio
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form.

Demo
A live demo can be found here.

UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel.

Technologies
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (3.3.7)
Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size.

Testing
This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.

Credits
Content
All content in the "About Me/À Propos" and "Work/Travail" sections in this portfolio site were written by me.

Media
All photos were taken from Pexels, a stock image library, with the exception of the photo of myself in the background of the 'about me/À Propos' section in the desktop view. A greyscale filter was applied to each one prior to upload to preserve the greyscale theme.

Acknowledgements
The progress circles from the skills section are modeled after the following Stack Overflow example. They were significantly modified to fit the styling, sizing, and progress for each skill.

The media query for the collapsed navbar regardless of viewport width was taken from this site.

This is for educational use.
