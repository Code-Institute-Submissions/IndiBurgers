# INDIBurgers

This website is for a burgerjoint called "INDIBurgers". this name is comes from the first part of my last name.  This website includes 
a bookings area, menu items and show the location and fetures of this burger place 
 
## UX
 
This wesbite is aimed to help provide information for customers who are looking to eat at Indiburgers. I wanted to make the website simple and clean as i have found
on many websites for restaurant they have complex websites with an overload of information. When i personally look online for a restaurant its simply to see the food,
the reviews, to book a table, and the location/contact information. This is what i strived to create with my website by creating a clean look navagting from section 
to section with ease was my goal. Using the darker colors with orange to match the color and style of the burger images.

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - bootstrap navbar. The bootstrap navbar was used to create a moving navbar the folowes the user scrolling to provide an easier way to jump from section to 
section. This was further helped by the colapsoble navbar, this was also used from bootstrap.

- Feature 2 - The features on this website, are click able buttons to move from section to section on the page while having a navbar that follows the page.

- Feature 3 - I had a form created that helps the user book a table for the night. this was a custom built form using extra help from the bootstraap program to help 
create a grid and stucture for my custom form.

- Feature 4 - I created an orange line that goes around the page to mark the top **navbar** and the bottom **footer**. This helped the user see what the top was and the
bottom while also giving a nice design and color to wrap around the whole website.


### Features Left to Implement
- future feature - I wanted to create a more advanced table booking system that shows the whole restaurants table layout and shows which tables are free per night. This 
became to hard for me to Implement and i choose to take it out in favor of a more simple booking form.

## Testing

I had testing my website on different screen sizes to make sure it all fits well together whatever device the user is using. how ever i stuck more to the mobile sizes of
later devices such as iphone 8,X,plus while also using the size for IPAD, as many people use ipads for home use.

I had some issues with image sizing for mobile versions, that i tried to solve for a long time. The images look great in full browser size, but got squezzed when shrunk 
to mobile sizes. 

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.

### Acknowledgements

The menu from the restaurant is taken from 25 degrees Bangkok [https://www.randblab.com/assets/menu/25%20DEGREES%20BKK/25degrees-bkk-2019-7-4.pdf]
this was because the website build was not about what food is on the website, and i used this to fill up space and speed the process up and not waste time creating a menu.
